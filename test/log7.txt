od -v -An -t fD -N80000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n'
to generate 80000000 bytes of floating point numbers from device noises
where -v to print all identical numbers
-An to disable outputing count
-t fD to specify floating point double
precision form of output
-N to specify how many bytes to output

the I use sort and time to measure time for sorting
/usr/bin/time -p /usr/local/cs/bin/sort -g --parallel=N < random.txt > /dev/null
where N specifies how many threads to operate
here is the result

N=1
real 177.96
user 177.78
sys 0.19

N=2
real 94.47
user 180.22
sys 0.23

N=4
real 52.38
user 180.57
sys 0.28

N=8:
real 33.68
user 189.77
sys 0.35

I ran these tests under emacs shell command.
In directory where random.txt is.
