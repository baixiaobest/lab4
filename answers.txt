# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
I used fork() in the main function. Every time parent program try to download
a file from a pear, it forks a child process to do the job (parent is too lazy
to do the job).

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
If a peer sends a big file name, when program is trying to read that file name
from buffer to filename buffer in format “GET %s OSP2P”, it will write out of
filename buffer and write to disk_filename buffer as well as peer_list pointer.
Then a list of peer will be lost, your program cannot request another peer
for the file.

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)
1)
When you send upload file /dev/random to another peer, file will be very big and eat up
downloading peer’s disk.
So I limit the maximum number of bytes can be transferred to 100 MB in task_upload function.
So a very big file transfer like /dev/random can be prevented. This feature was tested
by setting up another peer on my partner’s Mac.

2)
A malicious peer can attack another seeder peer by lying to tracker, say, telling 
tracker to get cat3.jpg, when actually it is not requesting cat3.jpg. Then tracker 
will give malicious peer a list of IP address, so attacker can ask for file
other than cat3.jpg from these IP address.For example, it can ask for ‘/etc/passwd’.
And seeder peer will, without realizing the danger, send the file to attacker.
To solve it, peer needs to check if requesting filename contains ’/’, so that files
other than working directory won’t be fetched. A checking function is implemented
in task_upload(). Program robustness against this attack was tested on a setup
attack from my Mac to my partner’s Mac.

3)
Data from a popular tracker could contains too many IP. When the buffer fills up
by peers IP, I parse them into peer list while filling the buffer. Then clear
the buffer for new incoming data.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)
1) 
File name overrun attack. It overflows the filename of other peers, so other
peers program will crash if they are unable to detect it. It is tested on
my partner Mac, and overrun is detected.

2)
Denial of service. In mode 2, I keep opening new connection with all the peers 
within the P2P network. So other peer will thing I am going to download the
file and may fork a process to manage my requests. But too many requests in a
given time will fill up peer’s process table and paralyze the P2P network.
This is tested against my partner’s Mac and successfully crashed it.

3)
Passive attack, attack on request.
I transfer /dev/random to any request and thus random data can fill up downloader’s
disk. This attack is also tested.
